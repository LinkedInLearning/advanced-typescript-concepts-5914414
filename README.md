<p>As TypeScript becomes increasingly important in both front-end and back-end development, understanding how to use its advanced features is quickly turning into an essential skill. Are you ready to take your skills to the next level to start writing better, faster, cleaner code? Join tech educator and developer Maaike van Putten as she shows you how to leverage the full power of TypeScript, going beyond its basic syntax and common usage. Maaike offers an in-depth exploration of several advanced concepts, including generics, advanced types, function overloading, sophisticated type manipulation, advanced modularization techniques, decorators and metadata, and build tool integration and optimization. By the end of this course, youâ€™ll be equipped with the skills and know-how required to start writing code in TypeScript with an expert-level proficiency.</p><p>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time-all while using a tool that you'll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the "How to use Codespaces" video to learn how to get started.</p>

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
